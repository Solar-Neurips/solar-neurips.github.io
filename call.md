<div class='description' style='font-size: 11pt;'>

As language models (LMs) revolutionize various fields, it becomes critical to ensure their respon-
sible development and deployment. This includes considering factors like alignment, security, and
fairness, while striving for bias-free, misuse-resistant, and interpretable models. Our workshop aims
to encourage a wider discussion on these societal impacts of LMs, promoting more socially conscious
and accountable LM research. We anticipate a broad array of submissions given the multi-faceted
impact of LMs. Our focus areas will include but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Security and privacy concerns of LMs [10, 17, 15]
<li>Bias and exclusion in LMs [9, 2]
<li>Analysis of the development and deployment of LMs, including crowdwork [26, 30], deploy-
<li>ment protocols [32, 28], and societal impacts from deployment [8, 13].
<li>Safety, robustness, and alignment of LMs [31, 6, 20, 19]
<li>Auditing, red-teaming, and evaluations of LMs [25, 24, 16]
<li>Transparency, explainability, interpretability of LMs [23, 12, 3, 27, 14, 22]
<li>Applications of LMs for social good, including sector-specific applications [7, 18, 11] and LMs
<li>for low-resource languages [4, 5, 21]
<li>Perspectives from other domains that can inform socially responsible LM development and
deployment [29, 1]
</ul>
We also encourage sociotechnical submissions from other disciplines such as philosophy, law, and
policy, in order to foster an interdisciplinary dialogue on the societal impacts of LMs.
