<p>The inaugural Socially Responsible Language Modelling Research (SoLaR) workshop at NeurIPS 2023 is an interdisciplinary gathering that aims to foster responsible and ethical research in the field of language modeling. Recognizing the significant risks and harms [33-37] associated with the development, deployment, and use of language models, the workshop emphasizes the need for researchers to focus on addressing these risks starting from the early stages of development. The workshop brings together experts and practitioners from various domains and academic fields with a shared commitment to promoting fairness, equity, accountability, transparency, and safety in language modeling research.</p>

<p>We anticipate a broad array of submissions given the multi-faceted impact of LMs. Our focus areas will include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security and privacy concerns of LMs [10, 17, 15] </li>
<li>Bias and exclusion in LMs [9, 2] </li>
<li>Analysis of the development and deployment of LMs, including crowdwork [26, 30], deployment protocols [32, 28], and societal impacts from deployment [8, 13]. </li>
<li>Safety, robustness, and alignment of LMs [31, 6, 20, 19] </li>
<li>Auditing, red-teaming, and evaluations of LMs [25, 24, 16] </li>
<li>Transparency, explainability, interpretability of LMs [23, 12, 3, 27, 14, 22] </li>
<li>Applications of LMs for social good, including sector-specific applications [7, 18, 11] and LMs </li>
<li>for low-resource languages [4, 5, 21] </li>
<li>Perspectives from other domains that can inform socially responsible LM development and
deployment [29, 1] </li>
</ul>

We also encourage sociotechnical submissions from other disciplines such as philosophy, law, and policy, in order to foster an interdisciplinary dialogue on the societal impacts of LMs.
